I would like you guys to tweak this a bit. Make it for supporting employees within an enterprise. develop a slack plug-in application which looks at individual messages in a slack support channel and routes the problem to the right people. NER tagger is a good idea. The app should also have a dashboard that can pull stats to help guide the support team planning and taking pro-active actions. Goal is to provide faster and inexpensive support. 

# SWIFT
SWIFT provides faster, inexpensive support for employees. The app will use NER (Named-Entity Recognition) to extract relevant details from employee messages and forwards them to the appropriate department or party which can handle the issue.

# Abstract
Today, Customer Service is very important in businesses. If customer complaints are not handled quickly, that leads to dissatisfaction which can promote a decrease in sales in the long run. So successful businesses do require the complaints to be addressed quickly. And when there are a lot of customer complaints to be addressed, it takes some time to forward the complaints to the respective department and solve the issue. In that scenario, SWIFT can help the businesses by forwarding the emails to the concerned department without any need of employees. This will reduce the time to solve the issue.
