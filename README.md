# SWIFT
SWIFT will use NER (Named-Entity Recognition) to extract relevant details from messages in a support channel and forwards them to the appropriate department which can handle the issue. 

I would like you guys to tweak this a bit. Make it for supporting employees within an enterprise. develop a slack plug-in application which looks at individual messages in a slack support channel and routes the problem to the right people. NER tagger is a good idea. The app should also have a dashboard that can pull stats to help guide the support team planning and taking pro-active actions. Goal is to provide faster and inexpensive support. 

# Abstract
Problem Statement â€“ Today, Customer Service is very important in businesses. If the customer complaints are not handled quickly, it leads to dissatisfaction which can promote decrease in sales in long run. So successful businesses do require the complaints to be addressed quickly. And when there are lot of emails to be addressed, it takes some time to forward the complaints to the respective department and solve the issue. In that scenario, SWIFT can help the businesses by forwarding the emails to the concerned department without any need of employees. This will reduce the time to solve the issue.

# Technology Stack
Node JS, Express JS, Slack API, Stanford NER tagger.
