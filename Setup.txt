How to setup and run:

1. The app is based off this tutorial: https://x-team.com/blog/slack-app-step-by-step/
Parts 1 and 2.

2. Install Node.js, the Yarn package manager, Express.js, and ngrok.

3. Git clone. Type
npm install
to install dependencies. Login to Slack SwiftDemo and navigate to "My Apps".

4. Create a .env file. This will hold the verification token under Basic Info->App Credentials
and the access token under Install App.

slack_app_token=...
verification_token=...

Git will ignore the .env file when you push later.

5. From the swift git repo:
Navigate to /src/ner-server/stanford-ner-2018-10-16.
Type the shell script .\ner-server.sh to start the NER server.
You can also just type the java command in the stanford folder.

6. From the git repo:
yarn run dev
And on a separate terminal:
ngrok http 3000
Copy the https address and paste onto the Event Subscriptions section's Request URL:
[url]/api/events
Save changes.

7. Go to Swift workspace. Now when you post a new message in the support channel, the 
message is read, the tagged entities are logged, and the message is reposted in the general channel.
