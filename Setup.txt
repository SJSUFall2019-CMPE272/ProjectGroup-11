How to setup and run:

1. The app is based off this tutorial: https://x-team.com/blog/slack-app-step-by-step/

2. Install Node.js, the Yarn package manager, Express.js, and ngrok.

3. Git clone. Login to Slack and navigate to "My Apps".

4. Create a .env file. This will hold the verification token under Basic Info->App Credentials
and the access token under Install App. Also add the workspace channel IDs.
You can get the IDs with the tester page on: https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.history

slack_app_token=...
verification_token=...
support_channel=...
general_channel=...

Git will ignore the .env file when you push later.

5. From the git repo:
yarn run dev
And on a separate terminal:
ngrok http 3000
Copy the https address and paste onto the Event Subscriptions section's Request URL:
[url]/api/events
Save changes.

6. Go to Swift workspace. Now when you post a new message in the support channel, the 
message is read and reposted in the general channel.
